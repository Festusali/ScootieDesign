# Scootie Design Challenge
## An implementation of the scootie page challenge.

The challenge requires that arrow positioning be accomplished with HTML and CSS alone. No JavaScript, no Images/SVG. Just Pure CSS.

The challenge is quite a tough one and this iis what I have at the moment. It is not perfect but somehow, am happy I could at least attempt it.

At the end, I learnt better. Yet, much more to learn.
